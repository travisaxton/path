SHELL SCRIPT TO PRINT OUT $PATH VARIABLE
----------------------------------------

Exactly what the title says. It's a bit of a chore to run 'echo $PATH'
and the output is messy and hard to read. With very little code, now 
you just have to type 'path' as a command and it will return the 
$PATH variable in a more readable format. 

Enjoy!
