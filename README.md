SHELL SCRIPT TO PRINT OUT $PATH VARIABLE
----------------------------------------

Exactly what the title says. It's a bit of a chore to run 'echo $PATH'
when you know the output is going to be messy and hard to read. With 
one line of code, now you just have to type 'path' as a command and it 
will return the $PATH variable in a more readable format.

Don't forget to add this to your $PATH!
